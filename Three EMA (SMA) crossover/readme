We have seen that the Number of profitable trade and the number of non-profitable trades is nearly
equal (i.e, No of Trades: 9338 No of Profitable Trades: 4724, Accuracy of Strategy: 0.51 ) but
Strategy return is still more than Buy and hold return (Buy and Hold Returns: 111.38, Strategy
Returns: 136.39). for further improvement of this strategy is either Change in Time frame or by
changing moving averager's period.
EMA/SMA period from (Fast,mid,slow)=(5,8,13) to (Fast,mid,slow)=(5,9,14) then our matrices
are going to be:
No of Trades: 9648
No of Profitable Trades: 4896
Accuracy of Strategy: 0.51
Returns:
Buy and Hold Returns: 111.38
Strategy Returns: 148.64
Drawdown:
Buy and Hold: -64.52
Strategy: -13.44
Changing the time frame from 5 to 10 the results are:
No of Trades: 4624
No of Profitable Trades: 2423
Accuracy of Strategy: 0.52
Returns:
Buy and Hold Returns: 111.38
Strategy Returns: 175.88
We can observe from above that when we changed the time frame from 5 min to 10 min and applied
the same ema crossovers strategy then the returns goes up to 176 % from 136%
